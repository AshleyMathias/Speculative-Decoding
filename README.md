An interactive playground to compare Normal Greedy Decoding vs Speculative Decoding in large language models (LLMs). Built with Hugging Face Transformers, powered by PyTorch, and wrapped in a simple Streamlit UI for fast experimentation.

üöÄ Features

Run Normal Greedy decoding with GPT-2 (baseline).

Run Speculative Decoding (Draft model + Target model acceptance/rejection).

Compare outputs and time taken for both methods.

Streamlit UI for user prompts ‚Üí try it out in the browser.

Works on CPU (slower) or GPU (much faster üöÄ).
